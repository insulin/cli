1) Developing on insulin
------------------------

### Use Composer

As Insulin uses [Composer][1] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way to develop on it is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

If you want, you can have composer globally for all your projects, just run:

	$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer.phar

Enjoy!
